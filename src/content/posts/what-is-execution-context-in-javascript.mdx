## Introduction

The execution context is one of the very essential component of a JavaScript
engine. The execution context is the environment in which the code is executed.
Everything in JavaScript happens inside an execution context. You can think of
it as a box that contains two components:

1. Memory Component
2. Code Component

## Creation of an Execution Context

Memory component is responsible for storing the reference to the variables and
functions in a key value pair. Code component is responsible for executing the
code. An execution context is created in two phases:

1. Memory Creation Phase
2. Code Execution Phase

In memory creation phase, JavaScript will parse the code line by line and will
allocate memory for each variable and function. For the variables, it will
assign a special value called `undefined` as the value of the key. In case of
functions, whole function will be copy-pasted in the value of the key. Let's
understand this with the help of a simple example.

```javascript
var num1 = 5;
var num2 = 7;
function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
var result = add(num1, num2);
```

In above code, we have declared two variables and one function. At first
JavaScript will always create a global execution context. In the memory creation
phase, it will allocate memory for `num1` and `num2` and will assign `undefined`
as the default value. When JavaScript will reach to line number 3, it will copy
the whole function into the value of the key `add`. As `result` is also a
variable so JavaScript will allocate the memory and assigns undefined to it. At
the end of the memory creation phase, the memory component will look like this:

```placeholder
num1: undefined
nu2: undefined
add: function(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
result: undefined
```

Now comes the phase two, where the code execution phase will start. In this
JavaScript will start executing the code line by line. In line number one and
two, it will assign 5 to `num1` and 7 to `num2`. In line number three, it will
skip the section as there is nothing to do. Once the JavaScript will reach to
line number 6, it will invoke the function `add` with the arguments `num1` and
`num2`.

Everytime a function is invoked, JavaScript will create a new execution context.
Again it will go through memory creation and code execution phases. Once it will
hit the return statement in the code execution phase, or it reaches to the end
of function (in case of void functions), it will delete the execution context
and will return the control to the calling execution context with the returned
value. In the above example, it will check the value of `num1` and `num2` from
the memory component and will return the sum of both.

## Call Stack

So by now, we have seen that JavaScript has to keep the track of the execution
context. It has to jump into the new execution context when it encounters a
function invocation and delete it once the code is executed. JavaScript uses the
concept of stack to keep track of this information, and it is known as
`call stack` in JavaScript.

The call stack is a stack of execution contexts. It's main purpose is only to
manage the execution context. Once, JavaScript will encounter a function
invocation in the code execution phase, it will create a new execution context
and will push it to the top of the call stack. After the function is executed,
it will pop the execution context from the call stack.

The Call stack maintains the "order of execution" of execution contexts where
the top of the call stack will always represent the current execution context.
The bottom of this stack will always represent the global execution context.
Once the whole code is executed, JavaScript will pop the global execution
context from the call stack.

## Quick Recap

Let's quickly recap what we have learned so far.

1. Everything in JavaScript happens inside an execution context.
2. By default, JavaScript creates a global execution context.
3. JavaScript uses the concept of call stack to keep track of the execution
   contexts.
4. Each execution will have a memory component and a code component.
5. In the first phase, JavaScript will allocate memory for each variable and in
   case of function, it will copy whole function.
6. In the second phase, JavaScript will execute the code line by line.
7. Once it encounters a function invocation, it will create a new execution
   context and will push it to the top of the call stack.
8. After the function is executed, it will pop the execution context from the
   call stack.
