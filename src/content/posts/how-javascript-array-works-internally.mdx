## Introduction

All JavaScript engine have their own implementation of the functions and methods
but in this article, we'll consider the implementation of
[Google's V8 engine](https://v8.dev/) which is one of the most famous JavaScript
engines.

## Objects in JavaScript

Objects in JavaScript are responsible for holding the mapping between key-value
pairs. These keys could be any random string. Even if we pass a number as a key,
JavaScript will first coerce it to string.

```JavaScript
const foo = {
  12e2: 'bar',
}

console.log(foo[12e2]); // bar
console.log(foo['12e2']); // undefined
console.log(foo['1200']); // bar
```

Here, key `12e4` is first coerced to string and becomes `1200` then `bar` value
is linked to it. Same thing happens while accessing the value also. `12e2` will
first be coerced to string and then foo will lookup for key `1200` and return
`bar` value. But in the case of string literal `12e2`, no coercion occurs as a
result it was not able to find any value with such key and therefore returns
undefined.

## Arrays in JavaScript

Arrays are also a type of object in JavaScript but with only numeric keys.
JavaScript engine can optimize these special objects with purely numeric keys
Google's V8 javascript engine is entirely written in C++ but C++ arrays can only
store a similar type of data.

### Element Kind in JavaScript

There is no concept of `int`, `float` and `double` in JavaScript. JavaScript
categorizes them as `number` type but the underneath implementation cares a lot
about type of elements being stored in the array. V8 engine tries its best to
optimize the array. The operations that are performant for `int` data type can't
be as much performed for string or double data type. To keep the track of stored
elements in a array, V8 assigns a `element kind` to each array. V8 uses these
`element kind` just to internally distinguish between the different type of
arrays

There are around 22 different `element kind` that V8 assigns to an array. Each
of them comes with a different performance optimizations. In this article we
will consider these main `element kind` and later will look at some of the
performance mistakes that we can avoid when it comes to arrays in JavaScript.

1. PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS
2. PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS
3. PACKED_ELEMENTS
4. HOLEY_SMI_ELEMENTS
5. HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS
6. HOLEY_ELEMENTS

### Packed Elements

Packed elements means that there are no holes (which we'll see later) in the
array. It is the most performant kind of array in V8. It is also the default
kind of array in V8.

```javascript
const foo = [1, 2, 3];
// Packed Element
```

### Holey Elements

Holey elements means that there are gaps in the array. It represents the sparse
array. These type of array will not be as performant as the packed array.

```javascript
const foo = [1, 2, 3];
foo[100] = 4;
// Holey Element
```

#### Packed/Holey SMI Elements

`SMI` means that the array is of type `Smi` which is a signed 32-bit integer.

```javascript
const foo = [1, 2, 3]; // element kind: PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS

const bar = [];
bar[100] = 4; // element kind: HOLEY_SMI_ELEMENTS
```

#### Packed/Holey Double Elements

`Double` means that there are one or more elements of type `Double` in the
array.

```javascript
const foo = [1, 2.5, 3]; // element kind: PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS

const bar = [];
bar[100] = 7.4; // element kind: HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS
```

#### Packed/Holey Elements

The elements that are not of type `Smi` or `Double` are considered regular
elements.

```javascript
const foo = [1, 2.5, 3, 'bar']; // element kind: PACKED_ELEMENTS

const bar = [1, 2, 2.5];
bar[100] = 'foo'; // element kind: HOLEY_ELEMENTS
```

The `element kind` could also change dynamically as we add or remove elements
from the array. Let's look at the below example for better understanding.

```javascript
const foo = []; // element kind: PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS

foo.push(1); // element kind: PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS
foo[100] = 2; // element kind: HOLEY_SMI_ELEMENTS
foo.push(5.2); // element kind: PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS
foo.pop(); // element kind: PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS
foo.push('bar'); // element kind: HOLEY_ELEMENTS
```

At the starting `PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS` is the default element kind. When we push
`1` to the array it still remains `PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS`. After adding holes in
the array, it changes `element kind` to `HOLEY_SMI_ELEMENTS`. In the same way,
pushing `5.2` makes the `element kind` move to the `HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS`.

One thing to notice here is that once the `element kind` is downgraded to
`PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS` it stays there. Even after removing the only double
element `5.2` from the array, `element kind` is still `PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS`
At the end, adding `bar` to the array makes the `element kind` move to
`HOLEY_ELEMENTS`.

Here is the diagram of the `element kind` transitions for better understanding.

![Element Kind Transition + `{"width":3200,"height":1800}`](/images/element-kind-transition-v8.png 'Element Kind Transition')

JavaScript internally uses C++ vectors to store the packed arrays. It will grow
dynamically. Once the holes are introduced, the underneath implementation will
be upgraded to the `hashmap`. Once the underneath implementation is upgraded it
cannot be degraded even if you remove that element. So time and complexity can
vary a lot by just your usage of the array.

## General Performance Tips

### Never access the array with out of bounds index

```javascript
const foo = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(foo[100] ?? 'some placeholder'); // 'some placeholder'
```

The above example is such a common practice followed by many JS developers, here
we are accessing `100` index of the array.However, the length of array is `3` so
the index is out of bounds. In this case, the V8 engine has to perform the
expensive prototype chain lookup. This will affect the performance of V8 engine
as V8 will be cautious about this situation and it will not remain as performant
it was before accessing the out of bound key.

### Avoid giving the initial capacity to the array

```javascript
const foo = new Array(3); // element kind: HOLEY_SMI_ELEMENTS

foo[0] = 1;
foo[1] = 2;
foo[2] = 3;
```

This will create a `HOLEY_SMI_ELEMENTS` array with the initial capacity of 3.
However, we are only storing `PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS` elements. Why should we lose
the optimizations of `PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS`?

```javascript
const foo = []; // element kind: HOLEY_SMI_ELEMENTS

foo[0] = 1;
foo[1] = 2;
foo[2] = 3; // element kind: PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS
```

Instead of giving the initial capacity to the array we can just create a empty
array and push the elements to it. This will ensure the `element kind` is the
same
