JavaScript is a very flexible programming language. It provides you with many
pre-implemented helper methods which you can't find in any other language. All
JavaScript engine have their own implementation of the functions and methods but
in this article, we'll consider the implementation of
[Google's V8 engine](https://v8.dev/) which is one of the most famous JavaScript
engines.

Google's V8 javascript engine's implementation of arrays is backed up by C++
arrays underneath, but it is a little complex. Your javascript array of integers
will be backed up by a c++ array of integers. There is no concept of `int`,
`float` and `double` in JavaScript. If your javascript array is a mixture of
`int` and `float` then the underneath implementation will be an array of
`doubles`. If you try to do something like,

```javascript
const a = [];
a[10000] = 15;
```

Then, the underneath implementation will be upgraded to the `hashmap`. Once the
underneath implementation is upgraded it cannot be degraded even if you remove
that element. So time and complexity can vary a lot by just your usage of the
array.

In this article, I would try to list down all the important array methods in
JavaScript

## Filter

The filter method expects a callback function to be passed as an argument, and
it will create and return a new array with all the elements that return true by
the callback function.

```javascript
const array = [12, 67, 6, 11, 9, -2, 14, 18, 99];
const result = array.filter((val) => val >= 10 && val <= 20);
console.log(result); // [12, 11, 14, 18]
```

## Map

The `map` method expects a callback function to be passed as an argument. It
will run that callback method for each value and returns the new array of
results

```javascript
const array = [2, 4, 6];
const result = array.map((val) => val * 2);
console.log(result); // [4, 8, 12]
```

## Concat

The `concat` method is used to join two or more arrays. Instead of changing the
current array, it will return a new array. If the arguments passed to the
`concat` method are not of string type then they are first converted to string
type.

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const array2 = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55];
const array3 = [111, 222, 333, 444, 555];
const result = array1.concat(array2, array3);
console.log(result); // 1 2 3 4 5 11 22 33 44 55 111 222 333 444 555
```

You can also use JavaScript's `spread` operator to concat two arrays.

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [10, 20, 30];
const result = [...array1, ...array2];
console.log(result); // 1 2 3 10 20 30
```

## ForEach

The forEach method expects a function as an argument, and it will iterate
through the array and run that the provided function on each value. It could be
an alternative to the traditional `for loop` in some cases.

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
function callback(value) {
  console.log(value);
}
array.forEach(callback); //1 2 3 4 5
```

The callback function accepts three values, the current item, index (optional)
and the array on which filter was called (optional).

// to be continued!
