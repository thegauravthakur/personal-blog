    JavaScript is a very flexible programming language. It provides you with many

    this article, I would try to list down all the important array methods in
    JavaScript

It is quite common for JavaScript developers to find `this` keyword to be confusing and understand it incorrectly.
To get the expected results, developers make random guesses and do hit and trial. They often assume that `this` refers 
to the lexical scope of the current function, which is definitely not true

To begin with, we must understand that the `this` keyword is a runtime binding whose value is determined at function 
invocation (where function is being called), not where it will be used. In order to determine what `this` is, we should 
look at how the function is called. There are different ways by which we can assign the value of `this` keyword.

## Default Binding
Default binding is applied whenever a function is invoked without using `call`, `bind`, and `apply` methods.
Furthermore, no `new` keyword is used and there is no additional context provided. We will cover all these in later 
part of the blog. In such scenario, default binding is applied and the `this` keyword will point to the 
global execution context

```javascript
function foo() {
    var name = 'Tom';
    console.log(this.name);
}
var name = 'Andy';
foo(); // Andy';
```

In the above example, the value of `this` inside foo will point to the global context resulting in "Andy" as the output.
The behavior changes when we execute the same function in the strict mode. With the strict mode and the default binding,
the `this` keyword will point to `undefined`.
