A heap is a special type of tree like data structure that will always provide
the maximum or minimum value at the root depending on the type of heap. We will
cover all about heap data structure in this article. Before going into the
details of heap data structure, let us quickly go over the basic concepts of
binary tree and its array representation.

## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two child
nodes.

### Array Representation of Binary Tree

We can easily visualize the binary tree as an array. The array representation of
a binary tree must follow the following rules:

1. The root node must be at index 0.
2. The left child of a node must be at index 2 \* i + 1.
3. The right child of a node must be at index 2 \* i + 2.
4. The parent of a node must be at index floor((i - 1) / 2).

Even if a node is not present in the binary tree, it must follow the
above-mentioned rules. For example, in case of below tree, the child of node B
is not present. So, the array representation of the tree must be:

### Perfect Binary Tree

A perfect binary tree is a binary tree with maximum number of nodes at each level.

### Complete Binary Tree

If you represent a binary tree as an array, then there shouldnâ€™t be any empty
gaps in between the first and last elements. Every full binary tree is also a
complete binary tree. A complete binary tree is a full binary tree upto height =
height - 1. Height of a complete binary tree will always be equal to log(n)

## Heaps

A heap is a complete binary tree. There are two types of heaps:

1. Max Heap
2. Min Heap

### Max Heap

![Max Heaps + `{"width":3200,"height":1800}`](/images/max-heaps.png 'Max Heaps')

A max heap is a complete binary tree in which every node is having a value
greater than or equal to all its descendants.

### Min Heap

![Min Heaps + `{"width":3200,"height":1800}`](/images/min-heap.png 'Min Heaps')

Min heap is a complete binary tree in which every node is having a value less
than or equal to all its descendants.

### Insertion in Heap

To insert a new element in a heap, we need to add it as the last element in the
array and move it upwards until it satisfies the heap property. The main thing
to notice is that the adjustment is done from the last element to the root. Here
is the code to insert a new element in a heap, we are considering it to be a max
heap.

```cpp
void Heap::insert(int value) {
    // a complete binary tree with one node is always a binary tree
    if (size == 0)
        heap[size++] = value;
    else {
        // add element to the leaf
        heap[size++] = value;
        // get the index of last item
        int index = size - 1;
        // get the parent index
        int parent = (int) index / 2;
        // push the value upwards till it satisfies heap property
        while (index > 0 && heap[parent] < heap[index]) {
            swap(heap[parent], heap[index]);
            index = parent;
            parent = (int) index / 2;
        }
    }
}

// time complexity: O(log n)
```

### Deletion in Heap

We can't delete any random element from the heap. We can only delete the root
node. After deleting the root node, we need to move the last element in the heap
to the root and then move it downwards until it satisfies the heap property. The
main thing to notice is that the adjustment is done from root towards the leaf.
Here is the code to delete root in a heap, we are considering it to be a max
heap.

```cpp
void Heap::heapify(int index) {
    int leftChildIndex = index * 1 + 1;
    int rightChildIndex = index * 1 + 2;
    int maxChildIndex = index;

    if (leftChildIndex < size && heap[leftChildIndex] > heap[maxChildIndex]) {
        maxChildIndex = leftChildIndex;
    }

    if (rightChildIndex < size && heap[rightChildIndex] > heap[maxChildIndex]) {
        maxChildIndex = rightChildIndex;
    }

    if (maxChildIndex != index) {
        swap(heap[maxChildIndex], heap[index]);
        heapify(maxChildIndex);
    }
}

int Heap::pop() {
    if (size > 0) {
        int poppedElement = heap[0];
        heap[0] = heap[size - 1];
        size--;
        heapify(0);
        return poppedElement;
    }
    return -1;
}

// time complexity: O(log n)
```

In max heap, whenever we delete an element, we get the largest element. We can
keep the deleted elements in the free space in the array. So, after deleting all
the elements, we will get the sorted array. This is the idea behind the heap
sort.

In heap sort, we first construct a min/max heap and then extract the root node
until the heap is empty. The overall time complexity of heap sort is Creation of
heap O(n log n) + Deletion of all elements O(n log n) which is just O(n log n).
We can also construct a min/max heap using the heapify algorithm which will only
take O(n) time if the array is readily available. This algorithm is mentioned
below.

### Heapify

In traditional approach, we add elements to the leaf and adjust it upwards but
in heapify the direction is opposite i.e. we adjust the element downwards. Here
is the code to heapify a single node.

```cpp
void Heap::heapify(int index) {
    int leftChildIndex = index * 1 + 1;
    int rightChildIndex = index * 1 + 2;
    int maxChildIndex = index;

    if (leftChildIndex < size && heap[leftChildIndex] > heap[maxChildIndex]) {
        maxChildIndex = leftChildIndex;
    }

    if (rightChildIndex < size && heap[rightChildIndex] > heap[maxChildIndex]) {
        maxChildIndex = rightChildIndex;
    }

    if (maxChildIndex != index) {
        swap(heap[maxChildIndex], heap[index]);
        heapify(maxChildIndex);
    }
}
```

We can also use heapify algorithm to create a new heap. We start from the leaf
node and maintain the heap property by sending the elements downwards.

```cpp
void Heap::constructHeap(const vector<int> &values) {
    if (size == 0) {
        for (int value: values) {
            heap[size++] = value;
        }
        for (int i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            heapify(i);
        }
    }
}
```

Heapify algorithm is able to create a heap in O(n) time whereas traditional
approach takes O(n log n) time for n elements. We should always use heapify if
the array is readily available.

### Priority Queue

A priority queue is a special kind of data structure which will always pop the
value with the highest priority. We can easily achieve this using a max/max
heap. We can also create a priority queue by storing the elements in a normal
array but this will not be efficient as the pop method will take O(n) time.

To make efficient priority queue, we can use a min/max heap. This will return
the highest priority element in just O(log n) time but this will also take O(log
n) time for each push whereas this will take constant time in case of normal
array. So we should always choose the method which is more efficient for our use
case.

### Quick Recap

1. A heap is a complete binary tree with a maximum height of log n.
2. A heap can be a max heap or a min heap.
3. A max heap is a heap in which every node is greater than or equal to its
   descendants.
4. A min heap is a heap in which every node is less than or equal to its
   descendants.
5. We can insert a new element in the heap by adding it to the end of the array
   and then moving it upwards until it satisfies the heap property.
6. We can't delete any random element from the heap except the root node.
7. We can delete the root node by replacing it with the last element and then
   moving it downwards until it satisfies the heap property.
8. Time complexity of insertion and deletion in heap is O(log n).
9. In heap sort, we first construct a min/max heap and then extract the root
   node until the heap is empty. This will give us the sorted array in O(n log)
   time.
10. We can also construct a min/max heap using the heapify algorithm which will
    only take O(n) time if the array is readily available.
11. Heaps are used to implement efficient priority queues.
