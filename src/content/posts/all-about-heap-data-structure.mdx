A heap is a special type of tree like data structure that will always provide
the maximum or minimum value at the root depending on the type of heap. We will
cover all about heap data structure in this article. Before going into the
details of heap data structure, let us quickly go over the basic concepts of
binary tree and its array representation.

## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two child
nodes.

### Array Representation of Binary Tree

We can easily visualize the binary tree as an array. The array representation of
a binary tree must follow the following rules:

1. The root node must be at index 0.
2. The left child of a node must be at index 2 \* i + 1.
3. The right child of a node must be at index 2 \* i + 2.
4. The parent of a node must be at index floor((i - 1) / 2).

Even if a node is not present in the binary tree, it must follow the
above-mentioned rules. For example, in case of below tree, the child of node B
is not present. So, the array representation of the tree must be:
