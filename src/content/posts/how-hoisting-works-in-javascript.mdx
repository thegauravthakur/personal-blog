Hoisting is very important concept in JavaScript. In many books and articles on
hoisting, they mention that, in hoisting, the variable declarations and
functions are copied to the top of the code. This is completely wrong. We will
understand the actual working of hoisting and how we are able to access
functions and variables before even declaration in this article.

Hoisting in JavaScript is a phenomenon where we can access the variables and
functions before they are initialized. For example,

```javascript
console.log(sayHello); // whole function copied
console.log(name); // undefined

var name = 'Gaurav Thakur';
function sayHello() {
  console.log('hello');
}
```

In the above example, we are able to access the variable `name` and the function
`sayHello` before they are initialized. In most of the languages, this action
will throw an error. But in JavaScript, things works a bit differently.

I highly recommend you to read this article about the
[working of execution context in JavaScript](/what-is-execution-context-in-javascript)
so that you can relate the concepts better. Let's quickly go through the concept
of execution context.

An execution context is created in two phases:

1. Memory Creation Phase
2. Code Execution Phase

In memory creation phase, JavaScript will parse the code line by line and will
allocate memory for each variable and function. For the variables, it will
assign a special value called `undefined` as the value of the key. In case of
functions, whole function will be copy-pasted in the value of the key.

So, when JavaScript encounters a variable or function before it is initialized,
it will check if the variable or function has been allocated in the memory. If
so it will return the value of the key which is `undefined` in case of variables
and function code in case of functions.

If a variable is not defined, and we try to access it, it will throw a
`ReferenceError` because the memory is not allocated for the variable in the
phase 1 of the execution context.

```javascript
console.log(name); // ReferenceError
```

In many books and articles on Hoisting, they mention that the variables
declarations and functions are copied to the top of the code. This is completely
wrong. The way execution context is created, is only the sole reason why we are
able to access the variables before initialization and why their initial value
is `undefined` and function code in case of functions.

## Quick Recap

1. Hoisting in JavaScript is a phenomenon where we can access the variables and
   functions before they are initialized.
2. Execution context will allocate memory for variables and functions in the
   phase 1 of creation of execution context.
3. For the variables, it will assign a special value called `undefined` and for
   the functions, whole function will be copied.
4. The way execution context is created, is only the sole reason why we are able
   to access the variables before initialization and why their initial value is
   `undefined` and function code in case of functions.
