I highly recommend you to read this article about the
[working of execution context in JavaScript](/what-is-execution-context-in-javascript)
so that you can relate the concepts better. I hope you have read the
above-mentioned article. Now, let's see how hoisting works in JavaScript.

Hoisting in JavaScript is a phenomenon where we can access the variables and
functions before they are initialized. For example,

```javascript
console.log(sayHello); // whole function copied
console.log(name); // undefined

var name = 'Gaurav Thakur';
function sayHello() {
  console.log('hello');
}
```

In the above example, we are able to access the variable `name` and the function
`sayHello` before they are initialized. In most of the languages, this action
will throw an error. But in JavaScript, things works a bit differently.

Every code in JavaScript is executed in an execution context. The execution
context will allocate memory for the variables and functions. In case of
variables, it will assign `undefined` as the initial value. But in case of
functions, it will copy the whole function code in the memory.

This is the sole reason why we are able to access the variables before
initialization and why their initial value is `undefined` and function code in
case of functions.

If a variable is not defined, and we try to access it, it will throw a
`ReferenceError` because the memory is not allocated for the variable in the
phase 1 of the execution context.

```javascript
console.log(name); // ReferenceError
```
